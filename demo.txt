What is your favorite movie?
Tenet, written and directed by Christopher Nolan.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
A tour of historical Mediterranean sites would be nice.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
The ability to remove prostate cancer in someone but only after we do a game of patty cake, duck-duck-goose, and freeze tag (in that order) without knowledge that doing so would let me cleanse them of their prostate cancer. This power is important to me because I hypothetically lost me paw to prostate cancer.
